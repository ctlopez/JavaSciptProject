				<h3>Our Beginning</h3>
				<p>In 1904, a young entrepreneur named Amadeo Giannini created the Bank of Italy in a converted San Francisco saloon. His goal was to make financial services available to everyone — not just the wealthy few. And so he did; after the 1906 quake and fire, Giannini set up a makeshift bank on the San Francisco docks, giving residents loans to rebuild, secured with only a handshake.</p>
				<p>In 1928, Giannini merged with Bank of America, and in 1930 acquired Occidental Life Insurance Company through Transamerica Corporation. The banking and life insurance businesses separated in 1956, with the latter taking the Transamerica name. And in 1972, the now iconic <a href="https://www.transamerica.com/individual/about-us/who-we-are/the-pyramid/">Transamerica pyramid</a> claimed its place in the San Francisco skyline.</p>
				<h3>Modern Day</h3>
